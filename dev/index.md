# Hello,

## My name is José Sandoval



As someone who has held various positions in areas of Communication and Design, I am proud to say that I am an experienced person who knows how to work effectively in diverse, institutional, and multidisciplinary environments.

I have a particular interest in public affairs and how to solve the social challenges that come with them. I participated in spaces for evaluation, innovation, and decision, and there I raised how communication can help to actively involve communities to find collective and lasting solutions to the problems that afflict them/us.
